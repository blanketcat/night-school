# Algorithms

The ambitious goal here is to create as complete a list of algorithms as is possible with:
* The input data type or structure
* The output data type or structure
* A limited set of output descriptors (i.e. true/false/minimum/maximum, value/set)
* A table best / average / worst case runtime complexity complete with invariants for each case (e.g. bucket sort in O(n) if initialized with n buckets)
* The time and memory requirements
* Categorical classifications
* Source for solid python implementations from industry standard libraries or builtins if they exist (i.e. `networkx` for graphs, `heapq` for heaps) or write them if they do not exist, (or if they seem like they would be interesting or fun to implement)
* Eventually, source for implmentations in C, C++, C#, Go, Java, JS, Ruby


We would probably also like to include a list of problems of characteristics

### Classifications

Algorithms, by nature of being sequences of operations, are more complicated to classify than data structure, which are static, due to possessing overlapping observable facets. Once we get to the algorithms of interest for the over-arching project, they will fall into several categories.

##### By Implmentation

* Recursion
* Logical
* Serial/parallel/distributed
* Deterministic / non-deterministic
* exact / approximate
* quantuum
