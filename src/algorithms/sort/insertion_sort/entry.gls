Insertion Sort

Insert a[i] into sorted array a[0:i-1] by pairwise swaps down to the correct position.

theta(n) steps
each step is theta(n) swaps WCS
theta(n^2)

if you replace the pairwise swaps with binary search, you can reduce runtime to 
Runtime: theta(n*log(n))
Memory:  theta(1)





Example:

a_sub_0 = [5,2,4,6,1,3]
a[i] > a[i+1] -> a[i] = a[i+1] and a[i+1] = a[i]
a_sub_1 = [2,5,4,6,1,3]
...
a_sub_2 = [2,4,5,6,1,3]
a[i] < a[i+1]
a_sub_3 = [2,4,5,6,1,3]
