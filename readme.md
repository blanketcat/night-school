# Night-School

My circumstances in life didn't afford the opportunity to finish college and it's been years since I went through The Algorithm Design Manual. So I am building this out to brush up on algorithms and data-structures to stay sharp for technical interviews, and (to keep it interesting and immediately rewarding) to create a useable reference library for myself.

This is a work in progress, and not exactly to any specific end. If you're a potential client or employer browsing this, *please* don't let this define the totality of my knowledge for you.

### The glossary

'''glossary.py''' is a little system to navigate through note files in the source. The goal is to be able to navigate through the project structure and read notes in a TUI from the CLI. I just thought it sounded like something practical to have and that this would be a good place to experiment with the implementation without pressure or consequences.

Note files are denoted as '''entry.gls'''
